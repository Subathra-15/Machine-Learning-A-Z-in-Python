This section of the repository focuses on **Regression techniques** as part of the *Machine Learning A–Z™: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2025]* course. Regression is a fundamental supervised learning approach used to model the relationship between dependent and independent variables.

The following regression algorithms are implemented with hands-on examples and datasets:

1. **Simple Linear Regression**

   * Predicts a dependent variable using a single independent variable
   * Example: Salary vs Years of Experience

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**

   * Uses multiple independent variables to make predictions

3. **Polynomial Regression**

   * Models non-linear relationships by transforming features into polynomial terms

4. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

   * Uses support vectors to perform regression in high-dimensional space

5. **Decision Tree Regression**

   * Splits data into regions based on feature conditions

6. **Random Forest Regression**

   * An ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness
